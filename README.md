"Reading maketh a full man; conference a ready man; and writing an exact man." Francis Bacon

Pomodoro BlogChat is a site for users to read, converse and write about topics. Each blog entry focuses on a single concept.

The brain operates in two fundamental modes focus diffuse mode. Work with focus attention for 24 minutes and relax for 5 minutes. Practice slow thinking and exercise to increase the ability to learn and recall. Understanding combined with practice and repetition in a variety of circumstances to truly gain mastery.

The inspiration for this application came from Francis Bacon's quote and  [Barbara Oakley: Learning How to Learn](https://tedsummaries.com/2015/03/04/barbara-oakley-learning-how-to-learn/).

## User Experience Design (UX)

## Strategy Plane

### Purpose

This site provides a community platform where learners can apply the approach by reading(focus-mode) a blog to learn, have a conversation(diffuse-mode) to understand, and posting a blog(practice to master) to share their understanding. Users will help each other learn.

A blog post will typically be an explanation of a concept or a how-to tip or trick. The idea is to apply the Pomodoro approach to focus the blog post on a small chunk of information that takes no longer than 25 minutes to digest.

A blog series in turn will consist of a playlist of blog posts. As coders, one of the most important skills is to break down a problem into components and write code in chunks to solve the problem.

Readers can ask the blog post author questions and participate in a discussion via comments.
